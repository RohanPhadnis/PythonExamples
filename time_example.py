Most of the 60 species of eagle are from Eurasia and Africa.[1] Outside this area, just 14 species can be foundâ€”2 in North America, 9 in Central and South America, and 3 in Australia. Eagles are not a natural group but denote essentially any bird of prey large enough to hunt sizeable (about 50 cm long or more overall) vertebrate prey.')
